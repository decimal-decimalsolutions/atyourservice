What skills and experiences do you bring that supports the role(s) you are interested in?

Being an innovator incubator facilitator this year, I understand the ins and out of this role. 
I want to work as an Advisor for this role so that I am involved in the planning/organizing and making it more successful.

There are lots of ways it can be improved. First, I would like Innovation to be more interesting and attractive.
I would like to suggest  
* A speaker from innovation department. 
* A list of major innovations/patents currently Wellsfargo have.
* Use of Jira/Kanban(Participants and Advisors) to track not only major milestones but also a minor task.
  I have skills of configuring, customizing and reporting in Jira

I enjoy working with people, I am a good collaborator, I used this skill in every activity in EDL program and outside; especially collaborated with EGS to team to successfully hosted 2 days EGS/US innovation incubator meet. 

I worked closely with EDL teams,  gathers status and issues that we present in the monthly update meeting.


What are your personal goals and what will you bring to the Everyday Junior Advisor Role?

* Pay it Forward: Giving it back to the community from where I have learned so much over this year
* Opportunity to drive the change; Change is the need of the hour.
* Bring Agile practices in the Everday Leader program
