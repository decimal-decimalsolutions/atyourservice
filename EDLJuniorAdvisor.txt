What skills and experiences do you bring that supports role(s) you are interested in?

Being an innovator incubator facilitator this year, I understand the ins and out of this role. I want work as an Advisor and contribute in planning, organizing and make innovation more attractive and successful. 

There are lots way it can be improved I would love to suggest changes like having a speaker from innovation department. If possible present a list of major innovations/patents currently Wellsfargo have.

I have good skill of Atlassian Jira, I would suggest of using it track not only major milestones but minor tasks also not only for participants but for Advisors also.

I enjoy working with people, I am a good collaborator, I used this skill in every activity in EDL program and outside; especially collaborated with EGS to team to successfully hosted 2 days EGS/US innovation incubator meet. 

Worked closly with EDL teams gathers status, issues and presented in monthly update meetings.

* Pay it Forward: Giving back to the community from which I learner over this year
* Opportunity to drive the change; Change is the need of the hour.
* Bring Agile practices in the EDL program
